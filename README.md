# Horizontal Scroll Gallery | V3

A smoother, sleeker, and more refined take on horizontal scrolling. **Version 3** builds on the solid foundation of V2 but cranks up the visual appeal and user experience. With modern gradients, more fluid scrolling, and refined responsiveness, this gallery now feels like a real showcase — not just a prototype.

Still light. Still library-free. Just HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript.

## 🔧 Improvements from V2

- 🎨 **Modernized Visual Design** — Clean gradients replace flat colors, giving each image card more depth and elegance.
- 🌀 **Smoother Scroll Feel** — Enhanced scroll handling with improved performance and better fluidity on touch and desktop.
- 📱 **Improved Mobile Experience** — Optimized for swiping and smaller screens with cleaner spacing and touch-friendly layout.
- ⚙️ **Cleaner Codebase** — Refactored CSS for readability and easier customization.
- 💡 **Ready for Expansion** — Layout and components are structured for quick styling and animation upgrades.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project continues the mission of exploring horizontal scrolling in a simple but visually interesting way. It's ideal for:

- Portfolios
- Product galleries
- Landing pages
- Interactive timelines or image-based storytelling

Think of it as a horizontally scrolling canvas you can turn into anything — minimal and light, but expandable and elegant.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- Displays a gallery of image cards that scroll horizontally.
- Enables vertical mouse wheel to trigger horizontal scroll.
- Smooth and responsive behavior on both desktop and mobile.
- Supports touch gestures natively — no libraries required.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- A container element uses `display: flex` with `overflow-x: auto`.
- JavaScript listens for vertical wheel events and translates them into horizontal scroll.
- Smooth scroll behavior is enabled for fluid motion.
- Images are styled with padding, shadows, and modern CSS enhancements.

## 🖼️ Design Notes

This version finally begins to look like something you'd put in production — or at least a proper portfolio draft.

Improvements include:
- Subtle **box-shadows** and **gradient backgrounds** for each image card
- Scrolling that feels less mechanical and more polished
- Layout padding for better breathing room

You can extend the design further by:
- Adding scroll snapping (`scroll-snap-type`)
- Animating image hover or focus states
- Embedding titles, captions, or overlays
- Using `IntersectionObserver` for lazy loading or animation triggers

⚠️ Older browsers might have issues with smooth scrolling or gradient rendering.

---

## 📌 Known Limitations

- No scroll snapping yet (but it’s easy to add).
- Scrollbar is visible by default — can be styled or hidden.
- No built-in accessibility for keyboard navigation (yet).
